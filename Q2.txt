Process of Deleting a Node:
Find the Node to Delete:

Start at the root and navigate through the tree to find the node containing the element you want to delete.
Identify Cases:

Once you find the node, identify its type based on the number of children:
If the node is a leaf (has no children), delete it directly.
If the node has one child, replace the node with its child.
If the node has two children, find its in-order successor (the smallest node in its right subtree), replace the node's value with the in-order successor's value, and then recursively delete the in-order successor.
Handling Leaf Nodes:

If the node to be deleted is a leaf (has no children), simply remove the node from the tree.
Handling Nodes with One Child:

If the node to be deleted has one child, replace the node with its child.
Update the parent of the node to be deleted to point to its child.
Delete the node.
Handling Nodes with Two Children:

If the node to be deleted has two children, find its in-order successor (the smallest node in its right subtree).
Copy the value of the in-order successor to the node to be deleted.
Recursively delete the in-order successor (which has become a duplicate in the tree).
Handling Edge Cases - Leaf Nodes with Two Children:
When dealing with a leaf node that has two children, the process remains the same. The in-order successor in this case will be the smallest node in the right subtree of the leaf node. The key is to replace the leaf node's value with the in-order successor's value and then recursively delete the in-order successor (which is guaranteed to have zero or one child).

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of deleting a node from a BST is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. For a balanced tree, the height is logarithmic (O(log n)), ensuring efficient deletion. However, in the worst case of a skewed tree, the height can be equal to the number of nodes (O(n)), leading to less efficient deletion.

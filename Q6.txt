AVL Trees:
Purpose:

AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree.
The primary purpose is to maintain balance, ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node (known as the balance factor) is at most 1.
Balancing Mechanism:

After every insertion or deletion, AVL trees check and adjust the balance factor of each node.
If the balance factor violates the balance criterion, rotations (single or double rotations) are performed to restore balance.
Advantages:

Provides fast search, insert, and delete operations with a guaranteed logarithmic height.
Well-suited for scenarios where a balanced tree is crucial, such as real-time systems and databases.
Red-Black Trees:
Purpose:

Red-Black trees are another type of self-balancing binary search tree.
The primary purpose is to maintain balance while allowing for a slightly more relaxed balancing condition compared to AVL trees.
Balancing Mechanism:

Each node in a Red-Black tree is assigned a color (either red or black).
The tree is structured to adhere to specific rules, including maintaining the same number of black nodes on any path from the root to a leaf.
After insertions or deletions, the tree is adjusted by performing color changes and rotations.
Advantages:

Slightly more permissive balancing rules compared to AVL trees, leading to faster insertions and deletions.
Still ensures a logarithmic height, providing efficient search operations.
Commonly used in scenarios where there is a mix of search, insert, and delete operations, such as in many standard libraries and databases.
Achieving Optimal Performance:
Both AVL trees and Red-Black trees achieve optimal performance by ensuring that the height of the tree remains logarithmic. This logarithmic height guarantees efficient search operations with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

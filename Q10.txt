Composite Tree Structure:
Root Node:

The root node represents the entire employee dataset.
Department Nodes:

Each department is represented by a child node under the root.
Each department node contains subnodes for different salary ranges within that department.
Salary Range Nodes:

Each salary range node contains subnodes for employees falling within that salary range.
The salary range nodes are further subdivided based on hire dates.
Hire Date Nodes:

Each hire date node contains subnodes for employees hired on a specific date or within a specific date range.
Querying:
Finding Employees by Department:

Traverse the tree to the desired department node, and retrieve all subnodes under that department.
Finding Employees by Salary Range:

Traverse the tree to the desired department and salary range nodes, then retrieve employees falling within that range.
Finding Employees by Hire Date:

Traverse the tree to the department, salary range, and hire date nodes, and retrieve employees hired on a specific date or within a date range.
Advantages:
Efficient Query Performance:

The tree structure allows for efficient hierarchical querying, narrowing down the search space at each level.
Logarithmic time complexity for search operations.
Dynamic Updates:

The structure is flexible enough to accommodate dynamic updates, such as adding new employees or modifying existing records.
Hierarchical Representation:

The tree naturally represents the hierarchical relationships between departments, salary ranges, and hire dates.
Considerations:
Balancing:

Depending on the dynamic nature of the dataset, consider using self-balancing tree structures to prevent degeneration into a skewed tree.
Memory and Indexing:

Optimize memory usage and indexing mechanisms to handle large datasets efficiently.
